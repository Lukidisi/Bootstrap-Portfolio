                    Any creative process is, at its core, a journey with a destination you must discover along the way. This is the simple principle that grounds my understanding of web design and drives my passion for technology. My name is Ian Lukidis, I hope we can take this journey together to a fully functioning and visually elegant new website that represents you.

                    A native chicagoan, I have always considered the midwest to be a 'home base' of sorts. My love of small rural towns and wooded areas drew me to Gambier Ohio, where I attended Kenyon college. I believe my mixture of time spent in a big city and secluded nature has given me a broader perspective on the world and the people around me.
